## About the project

### _Basic Structure:_
The `.elm` files in `src` folder are devided into mainly four parts. The files related to the basics of elm are in the direct directory, for example the `Main.elm`. Files about models in the game are put inside the `SubModels` folder, for example the `Enemy.elm`. Update-relating files are inside `Updates` folder, like `Battle.elm`. The files that provide basic logic and support for the game are inside `Util` folder, for example `Math.elm`. 

### _Elm Docs:_
To better understand the structure and details of the project, we suggest you to take a look at our [Elm-Docs](https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/silverfocs/elm-doc/2022/p2team09/packages/SilverFOCS-22/p2team09/latest/).
